/**
 * A mechanism for ensuring that at most N tasks are taking place at once.

 * Useful in Wireit to prevent running too many scripts at once and swamping
 * the system. For unlimited parallelism, just set numWorkers to Infinity.
 *
 * Note that node is still single threaded by default. This is useful for
 * Wireit because almost all work is happening in script commands which run
 * in separate processes.
 *
 * No guarantee is made about ordering or fairness of scheduling, though
 * as implemented it's currently LIFO. Deadlocks may occur if there are
 * dependencies between tasks.
