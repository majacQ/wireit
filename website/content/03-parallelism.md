## Parallelism

Wireit will run scripts in parallel whenever it is safe to do so according to
the dependency graph.

For example, in this diagram, the `B` and `C` scripts will run in parallel,
while the `A` script won't start until both `B` and `C` finish.

By default, Wireit will run up to 2 scripts in parallel for every logical CPU
core detected on your system. To change this default, set the `WIREIT_PARALLEL`
[environment variable](../reference/#environment-variables) to a positive
integer, or `infinity` to run without a limit. You may want to lower this number
if you experience resource starvation in large builds. For example, to run only
one script at a time:

```bash
export WIREIT_PARALLEL=1
npm run build
```

If two or more seperate `npm run` commands are run for the same Wireit script
simultaneously, then only one instance will be allowed to run at a time, while
the others wait their turn. This prevents coordination problems that can result
in incorrect output files being produced. If `output` is set to an empty array,
then this restriction is removed.
